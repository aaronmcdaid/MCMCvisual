    "This is the first post in a series I hope to write on a new clustering algorithm in Python. The model is essentially a Gaussian Mixture Model, so I will be comparing it with the [GaussianMixture](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html#mixture) algorithm in `scikit-learn`. My algorithm will be different, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and I have already implemented it in C++. I hope it will be quite accurate, estimating the number of clusters at least as accurately as existing methods, but I will have to sacrifice some scalability as a result. A visualization of my C++ algorithm is [online here](https://aaronmcdaid.github.io/demos/mvnMCMC/mvnMCMC.html) but I'm going to write this in Python as it will be more accessible via Python, and it will be a good project to help me dive deeply into Python and Jupyter notebooks and so on\n",

    "However, this first post is going to be quite small and simple. I hope to blog regular, small, posts on this topic as I make progress. I have multiple motivations for this: transition to Python 3, investigate existing clustering algorithms in Python, learn how to make nice Jupyter notebooks (including animations perhaps). Please give me feedback and help on everything!\n",
