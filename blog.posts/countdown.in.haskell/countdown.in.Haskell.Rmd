## Countdown solver, written in Haskell

I loved the British game show [*Countdown*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)) as a child,
which is based on [*Des chiffres et des lettres*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_chiffres_et_des_lettres).
My first attempt at a non-trivial C program was, if I remember correctly, and attempt to solve the "Numbers Round" on Countdown.

Given a target number, and six input numbers, the goal is to combine the inputs using only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and reach the target value.
For example, given target $562$ and inputs $9,8,2,10,4,4$

$$
562 = 2+10*(4*4-9)*8
$$

Let's assume, for now, that each input must be used once, and only once, in the expression. In reality, it is not necessary to use them all and I will describe that near the end of this post.

I'll call this pair, the target and the inputs, a *game*. A given game may have many solutions, or even zero solutions.

In this post, I'll describe a program written in [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)). I don't claim to be an expert in Haskell; this is just a bit of fun. I've recently become much more interested in it via the [Haskell Dublin Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Haskell-Dublin-Meetup/).

# Expressions

At first, let's consider using just two inputs, instead of the six that are allowed in the real game show. That gives us four expressions, where $a$ and $b$ will take the place of the inputs

$$ a +      b $$
$$ a -      b $$
$$ a \times b $$
$$ a \div   b $$

Allowing three inputs, the number of expressions increases dramatically, here are some examples
$$ a +   b \times c $$
$$ (a +   b) \times c $$
$$ (c \div   a) + b $$

The first step in Haskell is to represent the expressions. There are three kinds of expression:

1. `Letter` expressions. Just a single letter in isolation

   $$a$$

   $$b$$

2. `ExprT` expressions. `T`erm-expressions involving two terms with addition or subtraction

   $$a+c$$

   $$d-b$$

3. `ExprF` expressions. `F`actor-expressions involving two factors with multiplication and division

   $$a \times c$$

   $$d \div b$$

```
data Expr       =   ExprT Terms   -- term-expression  , i.e. two or more terms separated by (+) or (-)
                |   ExprF Factors -- factor-expression, i.e. two or more factors separated by (*) or (/)
                |   Letter Int    -- the Int is between 0 and 5 inclusive, for the six allowed variables
```

# Complex expressions

More complex expressions are classified according to the 'top-level' operation, respecting the typical [Order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) in arithmetic.
As a result, this is a term-expression:
$$
    b \times c + a
$$
because the addition is performed last. This is more clear with parentheses and spacing
$$
    (b{\times}c) + a
$$
or with this tree, where `*` represents multiplication:
```
         +      -- the top-level operation
        / \
       *   a
      / \
     b   c
```

On the other hand, the following is a factor-expression:
$$
    b \times (c{+}a)
$$
```
         *      -- the top-level operation
        / \
       b   +
          / \
         c   a
```

# Recursive definition of `Expr`

Focusing on `ExprT`, we need to represent the collection of two, or more, terms which are added or subtracted together. Each term is simply a subexpression

```
data Terms      = Terms Expr AddOrSubtract Expr
--                                          |
--                                          `----  second sub-Expr-ession
--                       |
--                       \-----------------------  first  sub-Expr-ession
```
where `AddOrSubtract` is simply `Add` or `Sub`:
```
data AddOrSubtract = Add | Sub
```

You might notice that this only allows two sub-`Expr`essions, when I said "two or more". To allow more than two terms, we allow that the first sub-Expr-ession might also be an `ExprT` expression. i.e.

$$ d+a+e $$

is represented as

$$ (d+a)+e $$

```
         +
        / \
       +   +
      / \   \
     d   a   e
```

A longer example is $a+b-c+d-e+f$, which we can represent as $((((a+b)-c)+d)-e)+f$.

To avoid redundantly generating many expressions which are obviously identical to each other, we ban expression such as

$$ (a+b)+(c+d) $$

which are identical to

$$ ((a+b)+c)+d $$

To enforce this, we require that the second sub-expression inside a `ExprT` must **_not_** itself be a `T`erm-expression. It may be `Letter` or `ExprF`.

# Constraints

To recap, with more clarity about the restriction we've just explained. There are three kinds of `Expr`:
1. `ExprT` - a term-expression made up of exactly two sub-Expressions, combined by either addition or subtraction, where the second subexpression must not be a `ExprT`.
1. `ExprF` - a factor-expression made up of exactly two sub-Expressions, combined by either multiplication or division, where the second subexpression must not be a `ExprF`.
1. `Letter` - a single letter from the six allowed: $a,b,c,d,e,f$
